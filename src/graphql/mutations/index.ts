// Export all mutation-related GraphQL operations

// Currently no mutations defined in this project
// Add mutation exports here as they are created

// Example for future mutations:
// export { createCustomerMutation } from './customer.js';
// export { updateOrderMutation } from './order.js';

export const mutations = {
  // Add mutations here as they are implemented
};
